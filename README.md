# Demographic Data Analyzer

## Project Overview
The Demographic Data Analyzer is a Python-based application that processes demographic data from a CSV file to extract insightful statistics about a population. This application leverages the Pandas library to perform various analyses, such as calculating the number of individuals from different races, determining the average age of men, and analyzing educational attainment relative to salary. Users can gain valuable insights into demographics, income distribution, and occupation trends through a series of calculations performed on the dataset.

## Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language for implementing the demographic data analysis.
Pandas: Utilized for data manipulation, analysis, and calculation of various statistics from the CSV dataset.
CSV File Handling: The application reads data from a CSV file containing demographic information to perform analyses.
This project illustrates how to extract meaningful insights from demographic data using Python, providing users with a clearer understanding of the underlying trends and distributions within a population.
